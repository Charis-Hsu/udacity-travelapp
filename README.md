### Project 
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. Given that this is the Capstone project, it's highly encouraged for you to go above and beyond, adding additional functionality and customization to truly stand out with a project you are proud to have at the top of your portfolio!

### Building
To build I followed the following steps, creating:

* Workflow to break project in small steps
* Wireframe of the website on https://mockflow.com
* Got my basic project setup and functioning in Visual Studio Code (HTML, installed SASS, wrote styles and set up a local server)
* Installed and configured Webpack (+ essential loaders and plugins)
* Set up async requests to fetch destination image and weather, based on user input, obtained from when the form is submitted by the user
* Refactored code, installed plugins to minify CSS and ran testing with JEST
